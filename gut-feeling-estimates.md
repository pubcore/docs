## Gut feeling estimates
How to get "rough" estimates of effort to fulfill some kind of work package?
Based on gut feelings: Estimation must be done by the one who can or will do
the work. Estimation result will be one of the following "natural" ranges
```
minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter, year
```

#### Meaning
* minute: 1 to 60 minutes
* hour: 1 to 24 hours
* day: 1 to 5 days
* week: 1 to 4 weeks
* month: 1 to 3 month
* quarter: 1 to 4 quarters
* year: 1 to open end

#### Usage for _receiver_ (the one who ask for estimate)
For instance, if you get the estimate "day", you know it may be one to 5 days.
Thats it. Do not ask for more accuracy. Just take it with you.  
It is up to the receiver to manage the "risk" which amount of days to use.  
__This will lead us to to get (good!) estimates very fast.__
If the work has started, you can ask again, after some time of work.

#### Usage for _worker_ (the one who will do the work)
1. If you have really no idea, ask for a short time box ("minute" or "hour") to walkthrough the work. It is importand to time-box this.
2. Walk through the units in mind, for instance: Is it possible in minutes? No. In Hours? No.
In days? No. In weeks? Maybe => estimate is "week".

#### Prerequisites
1. Trust.
2. Networking tool to record _Shared Understanding_. Every participant has read and write access to it. The estimates must be visible there.
